Create a Guessing Game (C programming Language)
Building a number guessing game in which a person can guess the number as many times he or she wants. we also provide hints like you are too high or too low which tells them that the number entered is higher or lower than the actual number and when finally they they guess it correct we tell us after how many attempts he got it right.
